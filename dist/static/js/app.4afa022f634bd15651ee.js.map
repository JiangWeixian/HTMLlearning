\"\\n\" + \"仅仅是如此而已，没有用到其他东西了。\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"## 正文 - 前期准备\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"### 建立`Vue`工程\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"利用`vue-cli`命令初始化`Vue`工程。该教程见[链接](https://cn.vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)。最终建立工程目录如下：\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"```\\n\" + \".\\n\" + \"├── build\\n\" + \"├── config\\n\" + \"├── index.html\\n\" + \"├── node_modules\\n\" + \"├── package.json\\n\" + \"├── package-lock.json\\n\" + \"├── README.md\\n\" + \"├── src\\n\" + \"└── static\\n\" + \"```\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"**注意**：初始化工程时候，并不建议添加任何代码检测工具，以及测试工具。\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"在将工程打包之前，对以下文件做修改：\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"* `config/index.js`在`build`一项中，修改\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"```\\n\" + \"assetsPublicPath: '/' 为 assetsPublicPath: './',\\n\" + \"```\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"**注意：** 意为'./'为根目录，因此在之后代码编写时候要切记这一点。\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"对于一个新建工程，以上修改已经足够。此时在工程根目录下执行`npm run build`。可以发现根目录中多了一个`dist`文件夹，文件夹中有`index.html`，如果可以在浏览器中显示，则工程打包成功。\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"#### 更多细节设置\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"假设并不是新建的`Vue`工程，而在工程中使用了`vue-router`以及使用了本地图片。则需要更多的设置。\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"* `vue-router` - 如果要打包工程，必须取消`vue-router`的`history mode`。使用`Github`服务器处理路由。\\n\" + \"* 若`vue`组件中使用了本地化文件（包括图片，字体）。则在`build/utils.js`进行修改，如下：\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"```\\n\" + \"if (options.extract) {\\n\" + \"      return ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\\n\" + \"        use: loaders,\\n\" + \"        fallback: 'vue-style-loader',\\n\" + \"        publicPath: '../../'  \\n\" + \"      })\\n\" + \"    } else {\\n\" + \"      return ['vue-style-loader'].concat(loaders)\\n\" + \"    }\\n\" + \"```\\n\" + \"\\n\" + \"以上。在工程根目录下执行`npm run
